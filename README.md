![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

The AI Content Detection Tool is a Python-based application that aims to identify and distinguish between AI-generated content and human-written text. It utilizes the OpenAI API to analyze input text and provide insights on whether the content appears to be authored by an AI or not. The tool is designed to help users assess the authenticity of textual content in various applications.

## Features

- Distinguish AI-generated text from human-written text.
- Utilizes OpenAI API for AI content analysis.
- Flexible and customizable for different use cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- OpenAI API key for making API calls.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/AI_Content_Detector.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install openai
```

### Usage

1. Obtain your OpenAI API key and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in `ai_content_detection.py` with your actual key.

2. Prepare your dataset: Create a file named `dataset.txt` in the same directory as the `ai_content_detection.py` file. Add a diverse set of AI-generated and human-written text samples, each on a separate line.

3. Run the AI Content Detection Tool:

```
python ai_content_detection.py
```

4. Enter the text you want to check when prompted.

5. The tool will analyze the input text and provide an indication of whether it appears to be written by an AI or not.
