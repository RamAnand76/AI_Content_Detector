Identifying AI-generated text from human-written text can be challenging due to advancements in AI technology. However, some guidelines and rules can help distinguish between the two:

Author Verification: If the authorship of the text is known, it is more likely to be human-written. AI-generated texts typically do not have a specific author.

Unusual Language Patterns: Look for unusual word choices, phrasing, or grammar structures, which can be indicative of AI-generated texts. AI models might generate content that is grammatically correct but sounds unusual.

Personalization and Emotion: Human-written texts often include personal experiences, emotions, and individualized perspectives. Lack of personalization and emotional depth may suggest AI generation.

Coherence and Creativity: Human-written texts generally exhibit more creativity, coherence, and storytelling abilities than AI-generated texts, which may lack a natural flow.

Contextual Understanding: Human-written texts often demonstrate a deeper understanding of the context, while AI-generated texts might provide generic responses without fully grasping the context.

Historical or Semantic Errors: AI-generated texts may produce historically or factually inaccurate information, while human-written texts are less likely to have such errors.

Repetitive Content: AI models might generate content with repetitive structures or phrases, while human-written texts tend to be more diverse and varied.

Immediate Response and Length: AI-generated texts might provide quick, short responses, while human-written texts could be longer and take more time to compose.

Consistent Tone: AI-generated texts might have a consistent tone throughout the entire content, while human-written texts can exhibit changes in tone based on emotions or context.
